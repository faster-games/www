## About

FasterGames was started to help game developers overcome the challenges that come with modern game development. These days, tools like Unity and Unreal provide a solid foundation to get started, but often require significant customization - That's where we come in. Our products and contracting services can help extend and customize that foundation to uniquely fit your game. We'll extend the engine, create in-engine tools, and work with your team to simplify common workflows. That way, you folks can focus on making a great game.
